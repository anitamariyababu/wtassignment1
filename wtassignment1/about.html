    <h3 style="color:blue">Since our modest beginnings in 2005 with a little space in Toronto’s stylish Yorkville locale, ‘Spark Restuarant’ ‘s development has been enlivened with the energy to cook and serve solid, Indian-roused takeout food. In contrast to other Indian eateries, ‘Spark Restuarant’ was made with the explicit expectation to appear as something else. We realize numerous individuals love Indian sustenance, yet a large number of them loathe or are unconscious of the regularly unfortunate fixings that make run of the mill Indian nourishment taste so great. Our menu highlights things that utilization the sound and fragrant flavors, however forgets the stuffing ghee, spread, oil, and overwhelming cream.</h3>
